## About

Hello World application using TypeScript, Aurelia and Webpack

## Setup

1. Install latest [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)

2. From the project folder, execute the following command:
 ```shell
 npm install
 ```
 This will install all required dependencies, including a local version of Webpack that is going to build and bundle the app.

3. Install webpack globally
```shell
 npm install -g webpack
 ```
4. Install webpack-dev-server globally
```shell
 npm install -g webpack-dev-server
 ```
5. To run the app execute the following command:
 ```shell
 npm start
 ```
 or 
 ```shell
 webpack-dev-server
 ```

 This command starts the Webpack development server that serves the built bundles. 
 You can now browse the app at http://localhost:3333/dist/index.html. 
 TODO: Changes in the code will automatically build and reload the app.
